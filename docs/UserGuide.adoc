== Introduction
StrinGen is an application that aims to facilitate the generation of ModReg strings (Boolean expressions) that specify module requirements.
It generates the string based on the user's input into the GUI by adding parenthesis and logical connectors. It also performs
slight simplification to the Boolean expression. While the application simplifies the string generation process through the GUI,
the user still has to possess some knowledge of logical relationships and be careful when entering the requirements.

== Quick Start
.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download `stringen.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
If double-clicking does not work, either:
- Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac), navigate to the folder where you downloaded the jar file and run
`java -jar stringen.jar`
- Or follow the instructions link:{https://www.pixelstech.net/article/1463037958-Run-executable-jar-on-double-click-on-Windows}[here] (Windows)

== Fields
=== Cohort Field
To specify the range of cohorts for which the following requirements apply. Below describes the options that should be
chosen for the various scenario.
====
* *No specific range*: `YEAR (default)` / `-`
* *All cohorts before* `SOME_YEAR`: `YEAR (default)` / `-` _TO_ `SOME_YEAR`
- E.g. Cohorts before 2013: `-` _TO_ `2013`
* *All cohorts after* `SOME_YEAR`: `SOME_YEAR` _TO_ `YEAR (default)` / `-`
- E.g. Cohorts after 2013: `2013` _TO_ `-`
* *All cohorts between* `YEAR_ONE` *and* `YEAR_TWO` (inclusive): `YEAR_ONE` _TO_ `YEAR TWO`
- E.g. Cohorts between 2013 and 2015: `2013` _TO_ `2015`
- Eg. Cohort 2013: `2013` _TO_ `2013`
====

=== Requirement Field
==== Numbered Requirements
image::NumberedRequirement.png[]

Numbered requirements (e.g. Requirement 1, Requirement 2) have _sub-requirements_ that are specified through dropdown boxes. These subrequirements can have
_AND/OR_ relationships that combine to form a greater (numbered) requirement. Each numbered requirement must be satisfied.
If there are 3 requirements (Requirement 1, Requirement 2 and Requirement 3), this translates into a string equivalent to
`Requirement 1 & Requirement 2 & Requirement 3`.

==== Sub-requirements
Sub-requirements are specified through the dropdown boxes. There are several different types of requirements to choose from, including: +
====
- Module Prerequisite
- Course Prerequisite
- MC Prerequisite
- Major Prerequisite
- CAP Prerequisite
- A-Level Prerequisite
- Course Preclusion
- Module Preclusion
- Major Preclusion
- Concurrent Module (Specified module has to be taken concurrently)
====
Each type of requirement has different fields that has to be entered.

[IMPORTANT]
====
*To Take Note*

* The fields in square brackets [] are optional and do not have to be filled in/entered.
* Module, Course and A Level Subject Codes have to be keyed in manually. Users are assumed to have these information.
* _Code format_: The `%` symbol is used to represent _all values_. For example, all modules with module codes starting with `HY`
should be written as `HY%`. This can be extended in other ways, such as `HY1%`, meaning all 1000 level HY modules.
====
===== Module Prerequisite
*Fields:* module code and [minimum grade] +
The minimum grade is set to be `D` by default if no grade is chosen.

===== Course Prerequisite
*Fields:* course code

===== MC Prerequisite
*Fields:* MC count and [module code]

===== Major Prerequisite
*Fields:* major code

===== CAP Prerequisite
*Fields:* CAP

===== A-Level Prerequisite
*Fields:* subject code and minimum grade

===== Course Preclusion
*Fields:* course code

===== Module Preclusion
*Fields:* module code and [minimum grade] +
The minimum grade is set to be `D` by default if no grade is chosen.

===== Major Preclusion
*Fields:* major code

===== Concurrent Module
*Fields:* module code

== Logical Buttons
=== Horizontal `add OR` button
image::HorizontalAddOr_AddAnd_Buttons.png[]
Most types of requirements have an additional `add OR`
button that appears after the requirement type has been chosen. This allows the user to input more than one requirement of the
same type.
[NOTE]
As the name suggests, clicking this button would indicate a logical `OR` relationship between each requirement along the same horizontal line.

=== Vertical `add AND` button
image::HorizontalAddOr_AddAnd_Buttons.png[]

Clicking this button would indicate a logical `AND` relationship between the requirement above and the requirement(s) below.

=== Vertical `add OR` button
Clicking this button would indicate a logical `OR` relationship between *all the requirements above and after the previous
`OR` (if any)* and the requirement(s) below.

image::AddOrLabel.png[]

The above example implies a relationship as such: (Module Prerequisite Requirement `AND` Module Preclusion Requirement)
`OR` (MC Prerequisite Requirement).

== Others
=== Adding another cohort
There is a button `Add another cohort` at the bottom left corner of the GUI that allows the user to enter requirements
for another cohort. The user can also delete the cohort by clicking the `DELETE COHORT` button at the top left corner, which
only appears when the user has added at least one other cohort. The user can also toggle between cohorts using the `Back` and `Next`
buttons at the bottom left corner.

=== Generating the string
The `Generate string` button at the bottom right corner of the GUI should be clicked when all the user has finished
entering all the requirements. The user can use the `Copy to clipboard` button to copy the entire string. There will be a message
below the string if the number of characters _exceeds 5000 characters_. The user can generate another string by clicking
the `Generate another string` button.

=== Deleting requirements
The `-` buttons beside each requirement can be used to remove unwanted requirements.

== Examples
The following are some examples on how to translate some requirements written in prose into logical statements.

* 40 MCs, *including* 20 MCs in HY modules and 20MCs in SC modules

image::Example1.png[]

* Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SE or 28 MCs in MS or 28 MCs in SN, with a minimum CAP of 3.50 or be on Honours track.
